# dot-net-coverage

A .net coverage tool that works by instrumenting the assemblies in a separate step, rather than by injecting at load time using profiling APIs

For a while, this was about the only tool that reliably worked on .net 4, 64 bit, so I've salvaged it from GoogleCode as a historical document.
