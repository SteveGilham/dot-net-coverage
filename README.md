# dot-net-coverage

A .net coverage tool originally introduced on [CodeProject](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/41722/Building-NET-Coverage-Tool) that works by instrumenting the assemblies in a separate step, rather than by injecting at load time using profiling APIs

For a while, this was about the only tool that reliably worked on .net 4, 64 bit, so I've salvaged it from [GoogleCode](https://code.google.com/archive/p/dot-net-coverage/source/default/source) as a historical document.
